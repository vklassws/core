<h1 align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vklassws/meta/main/static/banners/dist/core.svg" alt="VWS Core - ASPX Webscraper APIs"></h1>

VWS Core is the core of the VWS project. It is essentially a HTTP [request agent](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) simulating the actions done by a user. The built-in loaders can parse and extract data from VKlass' ASPX pages using the request pipeline. All requests are sent over encrypted https and the request headers are indistinguishable to a normal user, so there is no telling you're webscraping on their side.

## Security

### Vulnerability report

We take the security of our services and applications as well as users seriously, but we do not take any responisibility regarding security vulnerabilities in VKlass itself. If you have a suspected security vulnerability in any of _our_ services, _refrain_ from posting it anywhere publicly and report it directory to elias.skogevall@gmail.com.

### History Log

The history log may contain active sessions or tokens that ban be used to access your account. To prevent this, consider not using the history log at all. But if required, ensure not publicly posting your history log before the session has permanently run out.
